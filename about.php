			<img class="wrap_img" src="images/content.jpg">At the start of the 2008-2009 school year, fiscal, operational, and academic structures for Miami-Dade County Public Schools (District) were facing seismic shifts. There were $158 million in “technical deficiencies” in the District’s budget, the General Fund revenue was $2.6 billion which was $400 million less than just two years prior, the fund balance was at $4 million, and central office staff exceeded 2,000. Additionally, as the District entered the height of the recession, health insurance costs were expected to increase by $72 million within a year and the capital budget was tumbling by nearly 40%. Unmet facilities needs were approaching $1.8 billion and growing and there were serious inequities in physical plant conditions and access to technology among older and newer schools. Multiple schools were facing state closure due to poor student performance and a full cross-section of stakeholders were voicing serious concerns for the future of the fourth largest school district in the country. Under strong policy guidance and leadership from the Board and newly appointed Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho. <br><br> Changes were undertaken with a laser-like focus on students and their needs. By 2009, after comprehensively engaging stakeholders, a Strategic Framework was created that set the strategic trajectory for M-DCPS’s successes through 2015.
